	"description": "A longsword is a versatile weapon that can be used with one or two hands. When wielded with two hands, it deals 1d10 slashing damage instead of 1d8. It is a martial weapon, meaning that proficiency with it requires training. The weight of a longsword is 3 pounds, making it easy to carry in a backpack or on a belt. It costs 15 gold pieces to purchase, making it an affordable and reliable weapon for many adventurers. The longsword is a classic choice for fighters, paladins, and other melee combatants, and can be used in a variety of situations."
